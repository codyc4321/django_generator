need to convert Enum dicts to list of values, and randomly insert with element
this will prove what works for each value, like 'P' for patient, 'N' for 
no insurance, etc

need to sub out all charfields that have 'choices=...etc...' with elements
instead of random text

need to double check alotta files then start to write them to actual
unit_tests folder
